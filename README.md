## üìå Introduction

This repository documents my backend learning journey, including:

- Core concepts of **Node.js** and its runtime environment
- Building RESTful APIs using **Express.js**
- Working with **MongoDB** as the database
- Implementing **JWT authentication** for secure, stateless user sessions
- Using middleware for clean, modular server code

I‚Äôve also included a **Notion template** to help organize backend learning and projects efficiently.
